Model checking Petri nets with Transits against Flow-LTL/CTL
============================================================
A framework for model checking Petri nets with transits against Flow-LTL and Flow-CTL.
This module is the model and controller part of AdamMC.
It uses
[McHyper](https://github.com/reactive-systems/MCHyper) for generating a circuit from a circuit for the system and an LTL formula and
[ABC](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/) for model checking the resulting circuit.

Contains:
---------
- data structures for
  * alternating Büchi automata,
  * Kripke structures
- transformer for an alternating Büchi tree automaton and a Kripke structure to an alternating Büchi automaton
- transformer for an alternating Büchi automaton to a nondeterministic automaton
- The reduction methods for
  * Petri nets with transits / Flow-LTL to Petri nets and LTL
  * Petri nets with transits / Flow-CTL to Petri nets and LTL
  * Petri nets to Circuit

Integration:
------------
This module can be used as separate library and
- is integrated in: [adam](https://github.com/adamtool/adam), [adammc](https://github.com/adamtool/adammc), [webinterface](https://github.com/adamtool/webinterface),
- contains the packages: modelchecking,
- depends on the repos: [libs](https://github.com/adamtool/libs), [framework](https://github.com/adamtool/framework), [logics](https://github.com/adamtool/logics).

How To Build
------------
A __Makefile__ is located in the main folder.
First, pull a local copy of the dependencies with
```
make pull_dependencies
```
then build the whole framework with all the dependencies with
```
make
```
To build a single dependencies separately, use, e.g,
```
make tools
```
To delete the build files and clean-up
```
make clean
```
To also delete the files generated by the test and all temporary files use
```
make clean-all
```
Some of the algorithms depend on external libraries or tools. To locate them properly create a file in the main folder
```
touch ADAM.properties
```
and add the absolute paths of the necessary libraries or tools:
```
libraryFolder=<path2repo>/dependencies/libs
aigertools=
dot=dot
time=/usr/bin/time
```
You may leave some of the properties open if you don't use the corresponding libraries/tools.

Tests
-----
You can run all tests for the module by just typing
```
ant test
```
For testing a specific class use for example
```
ant test-class -Dclass.name=uniolunisaar.adam.tests.mc.circuits.TestingIngoingLTL
```
and for testing a specific method use for example
```
ant test-method -Dclass.name=uniolunisaar.adam.tests.mc.circuits.TestingModelcheckingFlowLTLParallel -Dmethod.name=exampleToolPaper
```
